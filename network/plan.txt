_NOTES TO HIEARCHY_
	Classes have their seperate folder!
	[*] .php and .inc are in the same (root) folder, little messy, but I like it that way.
	JavaScript has it's own folder, divided into JS and ajax, where JS is UI stuff, and ajax is for dynamic calls!

	Resources will contain all page resources, not uploads, uploads have their own seperate folder!
	[*] Make multiple stylesheets, make CSS look good (no [x] style.css!!!)!

	[*] pages have their own folder!
	[*] index.php is just a compilation of .php files, not much actual HTML!
	[*] Make different pages into different files, keep it minimalistic!
